# Movies' Map

This module is created to generate a map with locations of movies,
nearest to the given location in radians.

The generated map gives information how much movies were created
depending on the region (in some countries there are more than in others).

This map consist of three layers, which are the layer of general world map,
the layer of markers with locations of movies and the layer of lines, 
that links all this locations.

Here is an example of working module:

![text](terminal.jpg?raw=true "text")

And the generated map looks like this:

![text](map.jpg?raw=true "text")
